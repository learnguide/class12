(b) Why can one ignore quantisation of electric charge when dealing with macroscopic i.e., large scale charges? Ans. (a) Electric charge of a body is quantized. This means that only integral (1, 2, …., n ) 3 ","number of electrons can be transferred from one body to the other. Charges are not transferred in fraction. Hence, a body possesses total charge only in integral multiples of electric charge. (b) In macroscopic or large scale charges, the charges used are huge as compared to the magnitude of electric charge. Hence, quantization of electric charge is of no use on macroscopic scale. Therefore, it is ignored and it is considered that electric charge is continuous. 6. When a glass rod is rubbed with a silk cloth, charges appear on both. A similar phenomenon is observed with many other pairs of bodies. Explain how this observation is consistent with the law of conservation of charge. Ans. Rubbing produces charges of equal magnitude but of opposite nature on the two bodies because charges are created in pairs. This phenomenon of charging is called charging by friction. The net charge on the system of two rubbed bodies is zero. This is because equal amount of opposite charges annihilates each other. When a glass rod is rubbed with a silk cloth, opposite natured charges appear on both the bodies. This phenomenon is in consistence with the law of conservation of energy. A similar phenomenon is observed with many other pairs of bodies. 7. (a) An electrostatic field line is a continuous curve. That is, a field line cannot have sudden breaks. Why not? (b) Explain why two field lines never cross each other at any point? Ans. (a) An electrostatic field line is a continuous curve because a charge experiences a continuous force when traced in an electrostatic field. The field line cannot have sudden breaks because the charge moves continuously and does not jump from one point to the other. (b) If two field lines cross each other at a point, then electric field intensity will show two directions at that point. This is not possible. Hence, two field lines never cross each other. 4 ","8.

Opposite charges attract each other and same charges repel each other. It can be observed that particles 1 and 2 both move towards the positively charged plate and repel away from the negatively charged plate. Hence, these two particles are negatively charged. It can also be observed that particle 3 moves towards the negatively charged plate and repels away from the positively charged plate. Hence, particle 3 is positively charged. The charge to mass ratio (emf) is directly proportional to the displacement or amount of deflection for a given velocity. Since the deflection of particle 3 is the maximum, it has the highest charge to mass ratio. 10.

Due to the slight conductivity of the atmosphere up to about 50 km (beyond which it is good conductor), about + 1800 C is pumped every second into the earth as a whole. The earth, however, does not get discharged since thunderstorms and lightning occurring continually all over the globe pump an equal amount of negative charge on the earth.) Ans.

[a] Constant emf of the given standard cell, Balance point on the wire, A cell of unknown emf, , replaced the standard cell. Therefore, new balance on the wire, 59 ","The relation connecting emf and balance point is, The value of unknown emf is [b] The purpose of using the high resistance of 600 is to reduce the current through the galvanometer when the movable contact is far from the balance point. [c] The balance point is not affected by the presence of high resistance. [d] The point is not affected by the internal resistance of the driver cell. [e] The method would not work if the driver cell of the potentiometer had an emf of 1.0 V instead of 2.0 V. This is because if the emf of the driver cell of the potentiometer is less than the emf of the other cell, then there would be no balance point on the wire.

Hence, a paramagnetic sample displays greater magnetisation when cooled. 36 ","(b) The induced dipole moment in a diamagnetic substance is always opposite to the magnetising field. Hence, the internal motion of the atoms (which is related to the temperature) does not affect the diamagnetism of a material. (c) Bismuth is a diamagnetic substance.

(e) The earth's field, it is claimed, roughly approximates the field due to a dipole of magnetic moment located at its centre. Check the order of magnitude of this number in some way. (f) Geologists claim that besides the main magnetic N-S poles, there are several local poles on the earth's surface oriented in different directions. How is such a thing 41 ","possible at all? Ans. (a) The three independent quantities conventionally used for specifying earth's magnetic field are: (i) Magnetic declination, (ii) Angle of dip, and (iii) Horizontal component of earth's magnetic field (b) The angle of dip at a point depends on how far the point is located with respect to the North Pole or the South Pole. The angle of dip would be greater in Britain (it is about 70°) than in southern India because the location of Britain on the globe is closer to the magnetic North Pole. (c) It is hypothetically considered that a huge bar magnet is dipped inside earth with its north pole near the geographic South Pole and its south pole near the geographic North Pole.

The variation in earth's magnetic field with the time cannot be neglected. 43 ","(b) Earth's core contains molten iron. This form of iron is not ferromagnetic. Hence, this is not considered as a source of earth's magnetism. (c) The radioactivity in earth's interior is the source of energy that sustains the currents in the outer conducting regions of earth's core. These charged currents are considered to be responsible for earth's magnetism. (d) Earth reversed the direction of its field several times during its history of 4 to 5 billion years. These magnetic fields got weakly recorded in rocks during their solidification. One can get clues about the geomagnetic history from the analysis of this rock magnetism. (e) Earth's field departs from its dipole shape substantially at large distances (greater than about 30,000 km) because of the presence of the ionosphere. In this region, earth's field gets modified because of the field of single ions. While in motion, these ions produce the magnetic field associated with them. (f) An extremely weak magnetic field can bend charged particles moving in a circle. This may not be noticeable for a large radius path.

However, this is not true for rms voltage because voltages across different elements may not be in phase. (b) High induced voltage is used to charge the capacitor. A capacitor is used in the primary circuit of an induction coil. This is because when the circuit is broken, a high induced voltage is used to charge the capacitor to avoid sparks. 42 ","(c) The dc signal will appear across capacitor C because for dc signals, the impedance of an inductor ( L ) is negligible while the impedance of a capacitor ( C ) is very high (almost infinite).

(d) If an iron core is inserted in the choke coil (which is in series with a lamp connected to the ac line), then the lamp will glow dimly. This is because the choke coil and the iron core increase the impedance of the circuit. (e) A choke coil is needed in the use of fluorescent tubes with ac mains because it reduces the voltage across the tube without wasting much power. An ordinary resistor cannot be used instead of a choke coil for this purpose because it wastes power in the form of heat. 14.

Hence, power supplied by the plant = 800 kW + 6kW = 806 kW (c) Voltage drop in the power line = IR = = 300 V Hence, voltage that is transmitted by the power plant = 300 + 40000 = 40300 V The power is being generated in the plant at 440 V. Hence, the rating of the step-up transformer needed at the plant is 440 V – 40300 V. Hence, power loss during transmission = In the previous exercise, the power loss due to the same reason is . Since the power loss is less for a high voltage transmission, high voltage transmissions are preferred for this purpose. 46 ","CBSE Class 12 physics Important Questions Chapter 8 Electromagnetic Waves 1 Mark Questions 1.

A parallel plate capacitor (Fig. 8.7) made of circular plates each of radius R = 6.0 cm has a capacitance C = 100 pF. The capacitor is connected to a 230 V ac supply with a (angular) frequency of 300 rad . (a) What is the rms value of the conduction current? (b) Is the conduction current equal to the displacement current? (c) Determine the amplitude of B at a point 3.0 cm from the axis between the plates. Ans. Radius of each circular plate, R = 6.0 cm = 0.06 m Capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor, C = 100 pF = Supply voltage, V = 230 V Angular frequency, = 300 rad (a) Rms value of conduction current, I Where, XC = Capacitive reactance = 23 ","= 6.9 Hence, the rms value of conduction current is 6.9 (b) Yes, conduction current is equal to displacement current. (c) Magnetic field is given as: B Where, = Free space permeability I 0 = Maximum value of current = r = Distance between the plates from the axis = 3.0 cm = 0.03 m = Hence, the magnetic field at that point is 7. Figure 8.6 shows a capacitor made of two circular plates each of radius 12 cm, and separated by 5.0 cm. The capacitor is being charged by an external source (not shown in the figure). The charging current is constant and equal to 0.15 A. (a) Calculate the capacitance and the rate of charge of potential difference between the plates. (b) Obtain the displacement current across the plates. 24 ","(c) Is Kirchhoff's first rule (junction rule) valid at each plate of the capacitor? Explain. Ans. Radius of each circular plate, r = 12 cm = 0.12 m Distance between the plates, d = 5 cm = 0.05 m Charging current, I = 0.15 A Permittivity of free space, = (a) Capacitance between the two plates is given by the relation, C Where, A = Area of each plate Charge on each plate, q = CV Where, V = Potential difference across the plates Differentiation on both sides with respect to time ( t ) gives: 25 ","Therefore, the change in potential difference between the plates is V/s. (b) The displacement current across the plates is the same as the conduction current. Hence, the displacement current, id is 0.15 A. (c) Yes Kirchhoff's first rule is valid at each plate of the capacitor provided that we take the sum of conduction and displacement for current. 26 "]
