Hence, we can write the relation: Hence, the new apparent depth of the needle is 7.67 cm. It is less than h 2. Therefore, to focus the needle again, the microscope should be moved up. âˆ´ Distance by which the microscope should be moved up = 9.4 - 7.67 = 1.73 cm 9.

Use the mirror equation to deduce that: (a) an object placed between f and 2 f of a concave mirror produces a real image beyond 2 f. (b) a convex mirror always produces a virtual image independent of the location of the object. (c) the virtual image produced by a convex mirror is always diminished in size and is located between the focus and the pole. (d) an object placed between the pole and focus of a concave mirror produces a virtual and enlarged image. [ Note: This exercise helps you deduce algebraically properties of images that one obtains from explicit ray diagrams.] Ans. (a) For a concave mirror, the focal length ( f )is negative. âˆ´ f <0 When the object is placed on the left side of the mirror, the object distance ( u )is negative. âˆ´ u <0 62 ","For image distance v , we can write the lens formula as: â€¦(i) The object lies between f and 2 f . ( u and f are negative) â€¦(2) Using equation (1), we get: âˆ´ is negative, i.e., v is negative. Therefore, the image lies beyond 2 f . 63 ","(b) For a convex mirror, the focal length ( f ) is positive. âˆ´ f >0 When the object is placed on the left side of the mirror, the object distance ( u ) is negative. âˆ´ u <0 For image distance v , we have the mirror formula: Using equation (2), we can conclude that: Thus, the image is formed on the back side of the mirror. Hence, a convex mirror always produces a virtual image, regardless of the object distance. (c) For a convex mirror, the focal length ( f ) is positive. When the object is placed on the left side of the mirror, the object distance ( u ) is negative, For image distance v , we have the mirror formula: 64 ","But we have u <0 Hence, the image formed is diminished and is located between the focus ( f ) and the pole. (d) For a concave mirror, the focal length ( f ) is negative. When the object is placed on the left side of the mirror, the object distance ( u ) is negative. It is placed between the focus ( f ) and the pole. For image distance v , we have the mirror formula: 65 ","The image is formed on the right side of the mirror. Hence, it is a virtual image.

The outer covering of the pipe is made of a material of refractive index 1.44. What is the range of the angles of the incident rays with the axis of the pipe for which total reflections inside the pipe take place, as shown in the figure. (b) What is the answer if there is no outer covering of the pipe? Ans.(a) Refractive index of the glass fibre, Refractive index of the outer covering of the pipe, = 1.44 Angle of incidence = i Angle of refraction = r Angle of incidence at the interface = i ' The refractive index of the inner core - outer core interface is given as: 66 ","For the critical angle, total internal reflection (TIR) takes place only when , i.e., Maximum angle of reflection, Let, be the maximum angle of incidence. The refractive index at the air - glass interface, We have the relation for the maximum angles of incidence and reflection as: Thus, all the rays incident at angles lying in the range will suffer total internal reflection. (b) If the outer covering of the pipe is not present, then: 67 ","Refractive index of the outer pipe, = Refractive index of air =1 For the angle of incidence , we can write Snell's law at the air - pipe interface as: Since > r, All incident rays will suffer total internal reflection 16.Answer the following questions: (a) You have learnt that plane and convex mirrors produce virtual images of objects. Can they produce real images under some circumstances? Explain. (b) A virtual image, we always say, cannot be caught on a screen. Yet when we 'see' a virtual image, we are obviously bringing it on to the 'screen' (i.e., the retina) of our eye. Is there a contradiction? (c) A diver under water, looks obliquely at a fisherman standing on the bank of a lake. Would the fisherman look taller or shorter to the diver than what he actually is? (d) Does the apparent depth of a tank of water change if viewed obliquely? If so, does the apparent depth increase or decrease? (e) The refractive index of diamond is much greater than that of ordinary glass. Is this fact of some use to a diamond cutter? Ans.(a) Yes 68 ","Plane and convex mirrors can produce real images as well. If the object is virtual, i.e., if the light rays converging at a point behind a plane mirror (or a convex mirror) are reflected to a point on a screen placed in front of the mirror, then a real image will be formed. (b) No A virtual image is formed when light rays diverge. The convex lens of the eye causes these divergent rays to converge at the retina. In this case, the virtual image serves as an object for the lens to produce a real image. (c) The diver is in the water and the fisherman is on land (i.e., in air). Water is a denser medium than air. It is given that the diver is viewing the fisherman. This indicates that the light rays are travelling from a denser medium to a rarer medium. Hence, the refracted rays will move away from the normal. As a result, the fisherman will appear to be taller . (d) Yes; Decrease The apparent depth of a tank of water changes when viewed obliquely. This is because light bends on travelling from one medium to another. The apparent depth of the tank when viewed obliquely is less than the near-normal viewing. (e) Yes The refractive index of diamond (2.42) is more than that of ordinary glass (1.5). The critical angle for diamond is less than that for glass. A diamond cutter uses a large angle of incidence to ensure that the light entering the diamond is totally reflected from its faces. This is the reason for the sparkling effect of a diamond. 17.(a) Determine the 'effective focal length' of the combination of the two lenses in Exercise 9.10, if they are placed 8.0 cm apart with their principal axes coincident. Does the answer depend on which side of the combination a beam of parallel light is incident? Is the notion of effective focal length of this system useful at all? (b) An object 1.5 cm in size is placed on the side of the convex lens in the arrangement (a) above. The distance between the object and the convex lens is 40 cm. Determine the magnification produced by the two-lens system, and the size of the image. 69 ","Ans. Focal length of the convex lens, = 30 cm Focal length of the concave lens, = - 20 cm Distance between the two lenses, d = 8.0 cm (a) When the parallel beam of light is incident on the convex lens first: According to the lens formula, we have: Where, = Object distance = âˆž v 1= Image distance The image will act as a virtual object for the concave lens. Applying lens formula to the concave lens, we have: Where, = Object distance = (30 -d ) = 30 - 8 = 22 cm = Image distance 70 ","The parallel incident beam appears to diverge from a point that is from the centre of the combination of the two lenses. (ii) When the parallel beam of light is incident, from the left, on the concave lens first: According to the lens formula, we have: Where, = Object distance = = Image distance The image will act as a real object for the convex lens. Applying lens formula to the convex lens, we have: Where, 71 ","= Object distance = - (20 + d ) = - (20 + 8) = - 28 cm = Image distance Hence, the parallel incident beam appear to diverge 18.At what angle should a ray of light be incident on the face of a prism of refracting angle so that it just suffers total internal reflection at the other face? The refractive index of the material of the prism is 1.524. Ans. The incident, refracted, and emergent rays associated with a glass prism ABC are shown in the given figure. Angle of prism, Refractive index of the prism, Âµ = 1.524 = Incident angle = Refracted angle = Angle of incidence at the face AC e = Emergent angle = 72 ","According to Snell's law, for face AC, we can have: It is clear from the figure that angle According to Snell's law, we have the relation: Hence, the angle of incidence is 19.For a normal eye, the far point is at infinity and the near point of distinct vision is about 25cm in front of the eye. The cornea of the eye provides a converging power of about 40 dioptres, and the least converging power of the eye-lens behind the cornea is about 20 dioptres. From this rough data estimate the range of accommodation (i.e., the range of converging power of the eye-lens) of a normal eye. Ans. Least distance of distinct vision, d = 25 cm 73 ","Far point of a normal eye, Converging power of the cornea, Least converging power of the eye-lens, To see the objects at infinity, the eye uses its least converging power. Power of the eye-lens, = 40 + 20 = 60 D Power of the eye-lens is given as: To focus an object at the near point, object distance ( u )= -d = - 25 cm Focal length of the eye-lens = Distance between the cornea and the retina = Image distance Hence, image distance, According to the lens formula, we can write: Where, 74 ","= Focal length âˆ´ Power of the eye-lens = 64 - 40 = 24 D Hence, the range of accommodation of the eye-lens is from 20 D to 24 D. 20.Answer the following questions: (a) The angle subtended at the eye by an object is equal to the angle subtended at the eye by the virtual image produced by a magnifying glass. In what sense then does a magnifying glass provide angular magnification? (b) In viewing through a magnifying glass, one usually positions one's eyes very close to the lens. Does angular magnification change if the eye is moved back? (c) Magnifying power of a simple microscope is inversely proportional to the focal length of the lens. What then stops us from using a convex lens of smaller and smaller focal length and achieving greater and greater magnifying power? (d) Why must both the objective and the eyepiece of a compound microscope have short focal lengths? (e) When viewing through a compound microscope, our eyes should be positioned not on the eyepiece but a short distance away from it for best viewing. Why? How much should be that short distance between the eye and eyepiece? Ans.(a) Though the image size is bigger than the object, the angular size of the image is equal to the angular size of the object. A magnifying glass helps one see the objects placed closer 75 ","than the least distance of distinct vision (i.e., 25 cm). A closer object causes a larger angular size. A magnifying glass provides angular magnification. Without magnification, the object cannot be placed closer to the eye. With magnification, the object can be placed much closer to the eye. (b) Yes, the angular magnification changes. When the distance between the eye and a magnifying glass is increased, the angular magnification decreases a little. This is because the angle subtended at the eye is slightly less than the angle subtended at the lens. Image distance does not have any effect on angular magnification. (c) The focal length of a convex lens cannot be decreased by a greater amount. This is because making lenses having very small focal lengths is not easy. Spherical and chromatic aberrations are produced by a convex lens having a very small focal length. (d) The angular magnification produced by the eyepiece of a compound microscope is Where, = Focal length of the eyepiece It can be inferred that if is small, then angular magnification of the eyepiece will be large. The angular magnification of the objective lens of a compound microscope is given as Where, = Object distance for the objective lens = Focal length of the objective The magnification is large when > . In the case of a microscope, the object is kept close to the objective lens. Hence, the object distance is very little. Since is small, will be even smaller. Therefore, and are both small in the given condition. 76 ","(e) When we place our eyes too close to the eyepiece of a compound microscope, we are unable to collect much refracted light. As a result, the field of view decreases substantially. Hence, the clarity of the image gets blurred. The best position of the eye for viewing through a compound microscope is at the eye-ring attached to the eyepiece. The precise location of the eye depends on the separation between the objective lens and the eyepiece. 21.An angular magnification (magnifying power) of 30X is desired using an objective of focal length 1.25 cm and an eyepiece of focal length 5 cm.

Ans.(a) Refractive index of glass, = 1.5 Speed of light, c = m/s Speed of light in glass is given by the relation, Hence, the speed of light in glass is m/s. (b) The speed of light in glass is not independent of the colour of light. The refractive index of a violet component of white light is greater than the refractive index of a red component.

It is not affected by the motion of the source, the observer, or both. Hence, the given factor does not affect the speed of light in a vacuum. (b) Out of the listed factors, the speed of light in a medium depends on the wavelength of light in that medium. 11. For sound waves, the Doppler formula for frequency shift differs slightly between the two situations: (i) source at rest; observer moving, and (ii) source moving; observer at rest. The exact Doppler formulas for the case of light waves in vacuum are, however, strictly identical for these situations. Explain why this should be so. Would you expect the formulas to be strictly identical for the two situations in case of light travelling in a medium? Ans. No Sound waves can propagate only through a medium. The two given situations are not scientifically identical because the motion of an observer relative to a medium is different in the two situations. Hence, the Doppler formulas for the two situations cannot be the same. In case of light waves, sound can travel in a vacuum. In a vacuum, the above two cases are identical because the speed of light is independent of the motion of the observer and the motion of the source. When light travels in a medium, the above two cases are not identical because the speed of light depends on the wavelength of the medium. 12.

Suggest a possible explanation. (b) As you have learnt in the text, the principle of linear superposition of wave displacement is basic to understanding intensity distributions in diffraction and interference patterns. What is the justification of this principle? Ans.(a) Weak radar signals sent by a low flying aircraft can interfere with the TV signals received by the antenna. As a result, the TV signals may get distorted. Hence, when a low flying aircraft passes overhead, we sometimes notice a slight shaking of the picture on our TV screen. (b) The principle of linear superposition of wave displacement is essential to our understanding of intensity distributions and interference patterns.

(d) Two students are separated by a 7 m partition wall in a room 10 m high. If both light and sound waves can bend around obstacles, how is it that the students are unable to see each other even though they can converse easily. (e) Ray optics is based on the assumption that light travels in a straight line. Diffraction effects (observed when light propagates through small apertures/slits or around small obstacles) disprove this assumption. Yet the ray optics assumption is so commonly used in understanding location and several other properties of images in optical instruments. What is the justification? Ans.(a) In a single slit diffraction experiment, if the width of the slit is made double the original width, then the size of the central diffraction band reduces to half and the intensity of the central diffraction band increases up to four times. (b) The interference pattern in a double-slit experiment is modulated by diffraction from each slit. The pattern is the result of the interference of the diffracted wave from each slit. (c) When a tiny circular obstacle is placed in the path of light from a distant source, a bright spot is seen at the centre of the shadow of the obstacle. This is because light waves are diffracted from the edge of the circular obstacle, which interferes constructively at the centre of the shadow. This constructive interference produces a bright spot. (d) Bending of waves by obstacles by a large angle is possible when the size of the obstacle is comparable to the wavelength of the waves. On the one hand, the wavelength of the light waves is too small in comparison to the size of the obstacle. Thus, the diffraction angle will be very small. Hence, the students are unable to see each other. On the other hand, the size of the wall is comparable to the wavelength of the sound waves. Thus, the bending of the waves takes place at a large angle. Hence, the students are able to hear each other. (e) The justification is that in ordinary optical instruments, the size of the aperture involved is much larger than the wavelength of the light used. 37 ","10.Two towers on top of two hills are 40 km apart.

(b) The number of photons entering the pupil of our eye per second corresponding to the minimum intensity of white light that we humans can perceive . Take the area of the pupil to be about 0.4 cm2, and the average frequency of white light to be about . Ans.(a) Power of the medium wave transmitter, P = 10 kW = 104 W = 104J/s Hence, energy emitted by the transmitter per second, E = 104 Wavelength of the radio wave, = 500 m The energy of the wave is given as: Where, h = Planck's constant = c = Speed of light = Let n be the number of photons emitted by the transmitter. âˆ´ nE 1= E 45 ","The energy ( E 1) of a radio photon is very less, but the number of photons ( n ) emitted per second in a radio wave is very large.

In our experiment with rubidium photo-cell, the following lines from a mercury source were used: , The stopping voltages, respectively, were measured to be: Determine the value of Planck's constant h , the threshold frequency and work function for the material. [ Note: You will notice that to get h from the data, you will need to know e (which you can take to be ). Experiments of this kind on Na, Li, K, etc. were performed by Millikan, who, using his own value of e (from the oil-drop experiment) confirmed Einstein's photoelectric equation and at the same time gave an independent estimate of the value of h .] Ans. Einstein's photoelectric equation is given as: 50 ","Where, = Stopping potential h = Planck's constant e = Charge on an electron = Frequency of radiation = Work function of a material It can be concluded from equation (1) that potential is directly proportional to frequency . Frequency is also given by the relation: This relation can be used to obtain the frequencies of the various lines of the given wavelengths. 51 ","52 ","The given quantities can be listed in tabular form as: Frequency Ã— 1014 Hz 8.219 7.412 6.884 5.493 4.343 Stopping potential V 0 1.28 0.95 0.74 0.16 0 The following figure shows a graph between . 53 ","It can be observed that the obtained curve is a straight line. It intersects the at Hz, which is the threshold frequency of the material. Point D corresponds to a frequency less than the threshold frequency. Hence, there is no photoelectric emission for the line, and therefore, no stopping voltage is required to stop the current. Slope of the straight line = From equation (1), the slope can be written as: The work function of the metal is given as: 21.The work function for the following metals is given: 54 ","Na: 2.75 eV; K: 2.30 eV; Mo: 4.17 eV; Ni: 5.15 eV. Which of these metals will not give photoelectric emission for a radiation of wavelength 3300 Â¦ from a He-Cd laser placed 1 m away from the photocell? What happens if the laser is brought nearer and placed 50 cm away? Ans. Mo and Ni will not show photoelectric emission in both cases Wavelength for a radiation, = 3300 Speed of light, c = Planck's constant, h = The energy of incident radiation is given as: It can be observed that the energy of the incident radiation is greater than the work function of Na and K only. It is less for Mo and Ni. Hence, Mo and Ni will not show photoelectric emission. If the source of light is brought near the photocells and placed 50 cm away from them, then the intensity of radiation will increase. This does not affect the energy of the radiation. Hence, the result will be the same as before. However, the photoelectrons emitted from Na and K will increase in proportion to intensity. 22.Light of intensity falls on a sodium photo-cell of surface area . Assuming that the top 5 layers of sodium absorb the incident energy, estimate time required for photoelectric emission in the wave-picture of radiation.

Intensity of incident light, I = Surface area of a sodium photocell, A = = Incident power of the light, = = Work function of the metal, = 2 eV Number of layers of sodium that absorbs the incident energy, n =5 We know that the effective atomic area of a sodium atom . Hence, the number of conduction electrons in n layers is given as: The incident power is uniformly absorbed by all the electrons continuously. Hence, the amount of energy absorbed per second per electron is: Time required for photoelectric emission: 56 ","The time required for the photoelectric emission is nearly half a year, which is not practical. Hence, the wave picture is in disagreement with the given experiment. 23.Crystal diffraction experiments can be performed using X-rays, or electrons accelerated through appropriate voltage. Which probe has greater energy? (For quantitative comparison, take the wavelength of the probe equal to 1 Â¦, which is of the order of inter-atomic spacing in the lattice) . Ans.

Hence explain why a fast neutron beam needs to be the rmalised with the environment before it can be used for neutron diffraction experiments. Ans.(a) De Broglie wavelength = ; neutron is not suitable for the diffraction experiment Kinetic energy of the neutron, K = 150 eV 58 ","Mass of a neutron, mn = The kinetic energy of the neutron is given by the relation: Where, v = Velocity of the neutron = Momentum of the neutron De-Broglie wavelength of the neutron is given as: It is clear that wavelength is inversely proportional to the square root of mass. Hence, wavelength decreases with increase in mass and vice versa. It is given in the previous problem that the inter-atomic spacing of a crystal is about , i.e., . Hence, the inter-atomic spacing is about a hundred times greater. Hence, a neutron beam of energy 150 eV is not suitable for diffraction experiments. (b) De Broglie wavelength = Room temperature, = 27 + 273 = 300 K The average kinetic energy of the neutron is given as: 59 ","Where, k = Boltzmann constant = The wavelength of the neutron is given as: This wavelength is comparable to the inter-atomic spacing of a crystal. Hence, the high-energy neutron beam should first be the rmalised, before using it for diffraction. 25.An electron microscope uses electrons accelerated by a voltage of 50 kV. Determine the de Broglie wavelength associated with the electrons. If other factors (such as numerical aperture, etc.) are taken to be roughly the same, how does the resolving power of an electron microscope compare with that of an optical microscope which uses yellow light? Ans. Electrons are accelerated by a voltage, V = 50 kV = Charge on an electron, e = Mass of an electron, me = Wavelength of yellow light = The kinetic energy of the electron is given as: E = eV De Broglie wavelength is given by the relation: 60 ","This wavelength is nearly 105 times less than the wavelength of yellow light. The resolving power of a microscope is inversely proportional to the wavelength of light used. Thus, the resolving power of an electron microscope is nearly 105times that of an optical microscope. 26.The wavelength of a probe is roughly a measure of the size of a structure that it can probe in some detail. The quark structure of protons and neutrons appears at the minute length-scale of 10-15m or less. This structure was first probed in early 1970's using high energy electron beams produced by a linear accelerator at Stanford, USA. Guess what might have been the order of energy of these electron beams. (Rest mass energy of electron = 0.511 MeV.) Ans.

Find the typical de Broglie wavelength associated with a He atom in helium gas at room temperature and 1 atm pressure; and compare it with the mean separation between two atoms under these conditions. Ans. De Broglie wavelength associated with He atom = Room temperature, T = = 27 + 273 = 300 K Atmospheric pressure, P = 1 atm = Atomic weight of a He atom = 4 Avogadro's number, NA= Boltzmann constant, k = Average energy of a gas at temperature T , is given as: 62 ","De Broglie wavelength is given by the relation: Where, m = Mass of a He atom We have the ideal gas formula: PV = RT PV = kNT Where, V = Volume of the gas N = Number of moles of the gas Mean separation between two atoms of the gas is given by the relation: 63 ","Hence, the mean separation between the atoms is much greater than the de Broglie wavelength. 28.Compute the typical de Broglie wavelength of an electron in a metal at and compare it with the mean separation between two electrons in a metal which is given to be about . [ Note: Exercises 11.35 and 11.36 reveal that while the wave-packets associated with gaseous molecules under ordinary conditions are non-overlapping, the electron wave-packets in a metal strongly overlap with one another. This suggests that whereas molecules in an ordinary gas can be distinguished apart, electrons in a metal cannot be distinguished apart from one another. This in distinguish ability has many fundamental implications which you will explore in more advanced Physics courses.] Ans. Temperature, = 27 + 273 = 300 K Mean separation between two electrons, r = De Broglie wavelength of an electron is given as: Where, h = Planck's constant = m = Mass of an electron = k = Boltzmann constant = 64 ","Hence, the de Broglie wavelength is much greater than the given inter-electron separation. 29.Answer the following questions: (a) Quarks inside protons and neutrons are thought to carry fractional charges [(+2/3) e ; ( - 1/3) e ]. Why do they not show up in Millikan's oil-drop experiment? (b) What is so special about the combination e/m ? Why do we not simply talk of e and m separately? (c) Why should gases be insulators at ordinary pressures and start conducting at very low pressures? (d) Every metal has a definite work function. Why do all photoelectrons not come out with the same energy if incident radiation is monochromatic? Why is there an energy distribution of photoelectrons? (e) The energy and momentum of an electron are related to the frequency and wavelength of the associated matter wave by the relations: , p = But while the value of is physically significant, the value of (and therefore, the value of the phase speed ) has no physical significance. Why? Ans.(a) Quarks inside protons and neutrons carry fractional charges. This is because nuclear force increases extremely if they are pulled apart. Therefore, fractional charges may exist in nature; observable charges are still the integral multiple of an electrical charge. (b) The basic relations for electric field and magnetic field are 65 ","respectively These relations include e (electric charge), v (velocity), m (mass), V (potential), r (radius), and B (magnetic field). These relations give the value of velocity of an electron as and respectively. It can be observed from these relations that the dynamics of an electron is determined not by e and m separately, but by the ratio e/ m . (c) At atmospheric pressure, the ions of gases have no chance of reaching their respective electrons because of collision and recombination with other gas molecules. Hence, gases are insulators at atmospheric pressure. At low pressures, ions have a chance of reaching their respective electrodes and constitute a current. Hence, they conduct electricity at these pressures. (d) The work function of a metal is the minimum energy required for a conduction electron to get out of the metal surface. All the electrons in an atom do not have the same energy level. When a ray having some photon energy is incident on a metal surface, the electrons come out from different levels with different energies. Hence, these emitted electrons show different energy distributions. (e) The absolute value of energy of a particle is arbitrary within the additive constant. Hence, wavelength is significant, but the frequency associated with an electron has no direct physical significance. Therefore, the product (phase speed) has no physical significance. Group speed is given as: 66 ","This quantity has a physical meaning. 67 ","CBSE Class 12 physics Important Questions Chapter 12 Atoms 1 Mark Questions 1.

Suppose you are given a chance to repeat the alpha-particle scattering experiment using a thin sheet of solid hydrogen in place of the gold foil. (Hydrogen is a solid at temperatures below 14 K.) What results do you expect? Ans. In the alpha-particle scattering experiment, if a thin sheet of solid hydrogen is used in place of a gold foil, then the scattering angle would not be large enough. This is because the mass of hydrogen ( ) is less than the mass of incident Î±-particles ( ). Thus, the mass of the scattering particle is more than the target nucleus (hydrogen). As a result, the Î±-particles would not bounce back if solid hydrogen is used in the Î±-particle scattering experiment. 4. The ground state energy of hydrogen atom is -13.6 eV.

Potential energy = = - 27 .2 eV 5. If Bohr's quantisation postulate (angular momentum ) is a basic law of nature, it should be equally valid for the case of planetary motion also. Why then do we never speak of quantisation of orbits of planets around the sun? Ans. We never speak of quantization of orbits of planets around the Sun because the angular momentum associated with planetary motion is largely relative to the value of Planck's constant (h) . The angular momentum of the Earth in its orbit is of the order of 1070 h . This leads to a very high value of quantum levels n of the order of 1070. For large values of n , successive energies and angular momenta are relatively very small. Hence, the quantum levels for planetary motion are considered continuous. 2 ","3 Mark Questions 1.

Q9. A 12.5 eV electron beam is used to bombard gaseous hydrogen at room temperature. What series of wavelengths will be emitted? Ans. It is given that the energy of the electron beam used to bombard gaseous hydrogen at room temperature is 12.5 eV. Also, the energy of the gaseous hydrogen in its ground state at room temperature is - 13.6 eV. When gaseous hydrogen is bombarded with an electron beam, the energy of the gaseous 16 ","hydrogen becomes - 13.6 + 12.5 eV i.e., - 1.1 eV. Orbital energy is related to orbit level ( n) as: For n = 3, This energy is approximately equal to the energy of gaseous hydrogen. It can be concluded that the electron has jumped from n = 1 to n = 3 level. During its de-excitation, the electrons can jump from n = 3 to n = 1 directly, which forms a line of the Lyman series of the hydrogen spectrum. We have the relation for wave number for Lyman series as: Where, R y = Rydberg constant = = Wavelength of radiation emitted by the transition of the electron For n = 3, we can obtain as: If the electron jumps from n = 2 to n = 1, then the wavelength of the radiation is given as: 17 ","If the transition takes place from n = 3 to n = 2, then the wavelength of the radiation is given as: This radiation corresponds to the Balmer series of the hydrogen spectrum. Hence, in Lyman series, two wavelengths i.e., 102.5 nm and 121.5 nm are emitted. And in the Balmer series, one wavelength i.e., 656.33 nm is emitted. 10.Answer the following questions, which help you understand the difference between Thomson's model and Rutherford's model better. (a) Is the average angle of deflection of Î± -particles by a thin gold foil predicted by Thomson's model much less, about the same, or much greater than that predicted by Rutherford's model? (b) Is the probability of backward scattering (i.e., scattering of Î± -particles at angles greater than 90Â°) predicted by Thomson's model much less, about the same, or much greater than that predicted by Rutherford's model? (c) Keeping other factors fixed, it is found experimentally that for small thickness t , the 18 ","number of Î± -particles scattered at moderate angles is proportional to t . What clue does this linear dependence on t provide? (d) In which model is it completely wrong to ignore multiple scattering for the calculation of average angle of scattering of Î± -particles by a thin foil? Ans.(a) about the same The average angle of deflection of Î± -particles by a thin gold foil predicted by Thomson's model is about the same size as predicted by Rutherford's model. This is because the average angle was taken in both models. (b) much less The probability of scattering of Î± -particles at angles greater than predicted by Thomson's model is much less than that predicted by Rutherford's model. (c) Scattering is mainly due to single collisions. The chances of a single collision increases linearly with the number of target atoms. Since the number of target atoms increase with an increase in thickness, the collision probability depends linearly on the thickness of the target. (d) Thomson's model It is wrong to ignore multiple scattering in Thomson's model for the calculation of average angle of scattering of Î± -particles by a thin foil. This is because a single collision causes very little deflection in this model. Hence, the observed average scattering angle can be explained only by considering multiple scattering. 11.

Then what determines the typical atomic size? Why is an atom not, say, thousand times bigger 23 ","than its typical size? The question had greatly puzzled Bohr before he arrived at his famous model of the atom that you have learnt in the text. To simulate what he might well have done before his discovery, let us play as follows with the basic constants of nature and see if we can get a quantity with the dimensions of length that is roughly equal to the known size of an atom (a) Construct a quantity with the dimensions of length from the fundamental constants e , me , and c . Determine its numerical value. (b) You will find that the length obtained in (a) is many orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic dimensions. Further, it involves c . But energies of atoms are mostly in non-relativistic domain where c is not expected to play any role. This is what may have suggested Bohr to discard c and look for 'something else' to get the right atomic size. Now, the Planck's constant h had already made its appearance elsewhere. Bohr's great insight lay in recognising that h , me , and e will yield the right atomic size. Construct a quantity with the dimension of length from h , me , and e and confirm that its numerical value has indeed the correct order of magnitude. Ans.(a) Charge on an electron, e = Mass of an electron, m e= Speed of light, c = Let us take a quantity involving the given quantities as Where, âˆˆ 0 = Permittivity of free space And, The numerical value of the taken quantity will be: 24 ","Hence, the numerical value of the taken quantity is much smaller than the typical size of an atom.
