The teachers of Geeta’s school took the students on a study trip to a power generating station, located nearly 200 km away from the city. The teacher explained that electrical energy is transmitted over such a long distance to their city, in the form of alternating current (ac) raised to a high voltage. At the receiving end in the city, the voltage is reduced to operate the devices. As a result, the power loss is reduced. Geeta listened to the teacher and asked questions about how the ac is converted to a higher or lower voltage. (a) Name the device used to change the alternating voltage to a higher or lower value. State one cause for power dissipation in this device. Ans. Step up or step down transformer, Eddy current losses.

(a)State the principle of an ac generators and explain its working with the help of a labelled diagram. Obtain the expression for the emf induced in a coil havin N turns each of cross-sectional area, rotating with a constant angular speed ' '  in a magnetic field B  , directed perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Ans. Principle - Electromagnetic Induction AC Gene: The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction has been technologically exploited in many ways. An exceptionally important application is the generation of alternating currents (ac). The modern ac generator with a typical output capacity of 100 MW is a highly evolved machine. In this section, we shall describe the basic principles behind this machine. The Yugoslav inventor Nicola Tesla is credited with the development of 19 ","the machine. As was pointed out in, one method to induce an emf or current in a loop is through a change in the loop’s orientation or a change in its effective area.As the coil rotates in a magnetic field B, the effective area of the loop (the face perpendicular to the field) is cos , A  where  is the angle between A and B. This method of producing a flux change is the principle of operation of a simple ac generator. An ac generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The basic elements of an ac generator are shown in figure. It consists of a coil mounted on a rotor shaft. The axis of rotation of the coil is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The coil (called armature) is mechanically rotated in the uniform magnetic field by some external means. The rotation of the coilcauses the magnetic flux through it to change, so an emf is induced in the coil. The ends of the coil are connected to an external circuit by means of slip rings and brushes. When the coil is rotated with a constant angular speed  the angle  between the magnetic field vector B and the area vector A of the coil at any instant t is t    (assuming  = 0º at t = 0). As a result, the effective area of the coil exposed to the magnetic field lines changes with time, and from equation the flux at any time t is cos cos B BA BA t      From Faraday’s law, the induced emf for the rotating coil of N turns isthen, (cos ) B d d N NBA t dt dt      Thus, the instantaneous value of the emf is sin NBA t     ...(1) where NBA  is the maximum value of the emf, which occurs when sin 1. t   If we denote NBA  as 0 ,  then 0 sin t     ...(2) Since the value of the sine fuction varies between +1 and –1, the sign, or polarity of the emf changes with time. Note from figure that the emf has its extremum value when  = 90º or  = 270º, as the change of flux is greatest at these points. The direction of the current changes periodically and therefore the current is called alternating current (ac). Since 2 , v    equation 2 can be written as 20 ","0 sin 2 vt     ...(3) where  is the frequency of revolution of the generator’s coil. Note that equation 2 and 3 give the instantaneous value of the emf and  varies between 0   and 0   periodically. We shall learn how to determine the time-averaged value for the alternating voltage and current. (b) An aeroplane is flying horizontally from west to east with a velocity of 900 km/hour.

Ray diagram for image formation by a concave mirror Figure shows the ray diagram considering three rays. It shows the image ' ' AB (in this case, real) of an object AB formed by a concave mirror. It does not mean that only three rays emanate from the point A. An infinite number of rays emanate from any source, in all directions.Thus, point ' A is image point of A if every ray originating at point A and falling on the concave mirror after reflection passes through the point A. We now derive the mirror equation or the relation between the object distance ( u ), image distance ( v ) and the focal length ( f ). From Figure, the two right-angled triangles ' ' ABF and MPF are similar. (For paraxial rays, MP can be considered to be a straight line perpendicular to CP.) Therefore, ' ' ' BA BF PM FP    ' ' ' or BA BF PM AB BA FP    ...(i) Since ' ' APB A PB   , the right angles triangles ' ' ABP and ABP are also similar.

We now apply the sign convention. We note that light travels from the object to the mirror MPN . Hence this is taken as the positive direction. To reach the object AB , image ' ' AB as well as the focus F from the pole P , we have to travel opposite to the direction of incident light. Hence, all the threewill have negative signs.

This is the law of reflection. (b) In a single slit diffraction experiment, the width of the slit is made double the originalwidth.

Calculate the speed of light in the prism. Solution: Wave front:- where light is emitted from a source, then the particles (a) present around it begins to vibrate, the locus at all such particles which are vibrating in the same phase is termed as wavefront Laws of refraction :- Suppose when distribution from point P on incident wave front reaches point P on the refracted wavefront the disturbance from point Q reaches the point Q or the refracting surface XY. Since, A'Q'P' represents the refracted wave front the time takes by light to travel from a point on incident wave front to the corresponding point on refracted wave front would always be the same.

(b) polarisation by scattering :- polarisation also occurs when light is scattered while travelling though of medium. When light strikes the atoms of a material if will often set the electrons of those atoms into vibrations the vibrating electrons then produce their own electromagnetic wave that is radiated outward in all directions. These vibrating electrons produce another electron magnetic wave that is once more radiated outward in all directions. This absorption and refraction of light waves causes the light to be scattered about the medium. This process of scattering contributes to the blueress of our sky. This scattered light is partially moralized.

The output of band pass filter is an AM wave. 2. A planar loop of rectangular shape is moved within the region of a uniform magnetic field acting perpendicular to its plane. What is the direction and magnitude of the current induced in it ? Solution: The magnetic flux linked with a circuit is not changing with time so there will be no induced current in the loop. ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 2 / 24 3. When light travels from an optically denser medium to a rarer medium, why does the critical angle of incidence depend on the colour of light ? Solution: The critical angle for a given pair of medium is given by 1 c Sin i   where μ is refractive index of denser medium. The refractive index of a medium depends on the wavelength by the relation 2 B A    and each colour of light is associated with specific wavelength, so as the wavelength of light increases critical angle increases. 4. V-I graph for a metallic wire at two different temperature T1 and T2 is as shown in the figure. Which of the two temperature is higher and why ? Solution: The slope of V-I graph gives the resistance of the metallic wire and the slope is higher at temperature T1 and we know that on increasing the temperature of metallic wire resistance of the wire increases, so T1 temperature is higher. 5. Define dielectric constant of a medium. What is its S.I. unit ? Solution: Dielectric constant (or relative permittivity) of a dielectric is the ratio of the absolute permittivity of a medium to the absolute permittivity of free space. K     It is unit less quantity. Section B 6. Define a wave front. Using 'Huygens' principle, draw the shape of a refracted wave front, when a plane wave is incident on a convex lens. or (a) When a wave is propagating from a rarer to a denser medium, which characteristic of the wave does not change and why ? (b) What is the ratio of the velocity of the wave in the two media of refractive indices μ1 and μ2 ? Solution: The locus of points, which oscillate in phase is called a wave front; thus a wave front is defined as a surface of constant phase. ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 3 / 24 In the given figure we consider a plane wave incident on a thin convex lens, the emerging wave front is spherical and converges to the point F which is known as the focus. OR (a) Frequency of a wave does not change when the wave is propagating from a rarer to a denser medium because frequency ( ν ) is given by the relation v v   As the medium changes velocity (v) and wavelength ( λ ) changes such that ratio remains constant. (b) 1 2 2 1 v v    Here v1 and v2 are the velocity of the wave in medium 1 and medium 2 and μ1 and μ2 are the refractive index of medium 1 and medium 2. 7.

Draw a plot showing the variation of (i) Terminal voltage V and (ii) the current I, as a function of R. Solution: (i) Terminal voltage across a cell as a function of R As resistance R increases current (I) in the circuit decreases and terminal voltage (V) increases. We know V = ε – Ir ; Where ε is emf of the cell (ii) Current I as a function of R. ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 4 / 24 The current across a cell is given by I R r    When R increases I decreases 8. Differentiate between amplitude modulated (AM) and frequency modulated (FM) waves by drawing suitable diagrams. Why is FM signal preferred over AM signal ? Solution: When the amplitude of carrier wave is changed in accordance with the intensity of the signal, it is called amplitude modulation. When the frequency of carrier wave is changed in accordance with the intensity of the signal, it is called frequency modulation. Modulation of a carrier wave: (a) a sinusoidal carrier wave; (b) a modulating signal; (c) amplitude modulation; (d) frequency modulation FM signal is preferred over AM signal because (i) Various electrical machines and noises cause amplitude disturbance in the transmission of amplitude modulated wave. This makes the reception noisy. So, there is a need for Frequency Modulation which can reduce the noise factor. (ii) Fidelity or audio quality of amplitude modulated transmission is poor. This type of transmission is also not good for musical programmes. There is a need to eliminate amplitude-sensitive noise. This is possible if we eliminate amplitude variation. In other words, there is a need to keep the amplitude of the carrier constant. This is precisely what we do in frequency modulation. 9.

Name the three different modes of propagation in a communication system. State briefly why do the electromagnetic waves with frequency range from a few MHz upto 30 MHz can reflect back to the earth. What happens when the frequency range exceeds this limit? Solution: The three different modes of propagation in a communication system are (1) Ground wave (2) Sky wave (3) Space wave ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 7 / 24 In the frequency range from a few MHz up to 30 to 40 MHz, long distance communication can be achieved by ionospheric reflection of radio waves back towards the earth. This mode of propagation is called sky wave propagation and is used by short wave broadcast services. The ionosphere is so called because of the presence of a large number of ions or charged particles. It extends from a height of ~ 65 Km to about 400 Km above the earth’s surface. Ionisation occurs due to the absorption of the ultraviolet and o ther high-energy radiation coming from the sun by air molecules. The ionosphere is further subdivided into several layers. The degree of ionisation varies with the height. The density of atmosphere decreases with height. At great heights the solar radiation is intense but there are few molecules to be ionised. Close to the earth, even though the molecular concentration is very high, the radiation intensity is low so that the ionisation is again low. However, at some intermediate heights, there occurs a peak of ionisation density. The ionospheric layer acts as a reflector for a certain range of frequencies (3 to 30 MHz). Electromagnetic waves of frequencies higher than 30 MHz penetrate the ionosphere and escape. The phenomenon of bending of em waves so that they are diverted towards the earth is similar to total internal reflection in optics 14. Define the terms stopping potential' and 'threshold frequency' in relation to photoelectric effect. How does one determine these physical quantities using Einstein's equation ? Solution: Stopping potential : For a particular frequency of incident radiation, the minimum negative (retarding) potential V 0 given to the anode plate for which the photocurrent stops or becomes zero is called the cut-off or stopping potential. Threshold frequency : There exists a certain minimum cut-off frequency ν 0 for which the stopping potential is zero and below ν 0 the electron emission is not possible. This cut-off frequency is known as threshold frequency ν 0 , which is different for different metal. In photoelectric effect, an electron absorbs a quantum of energy (hν ) of radiation. If this quantum of energy absorbed by electron exceeds the minimum energy required to come out of the metal surface by electron, the kinetic energy of the emitted electron is K = h ν – φ ... (1) where, φ is the minimum energy for electron to come out of the metal, and is different for different electrons in the metal. The maximum kinetic energy of photo electrons is given by K max = hν – φ 0 ... (2) where, φ 0 – work function or least value of φ equation (2) is known as Einstein's photoelectric equation. Explanation of photoelectric effect with the help of Einstein's photoelectric equation (i) According to equation (2), K max depends linearly on ν, and is independent of intensity of radiation. This happens because, here, photoelectric effect arises from the absorption of a single quantum of radiation by a single electron. The intensity of radiation (that is proportional to the number of energy quanta per unit area per unit time) is irrelevant to this basic process. (ii) Since K max must be non-negative, equation (2) implies that photoelectric e mission is possible only if h ν > φ 0 or ν > ν 0 , where ν 0 = 0 V h    Thus, there exists a threshold frequency ν 0 = 0 V h    exists, below which photoelectric emission is not possible, and is independent of intensity. (iii) As intensity of radiation is proportional to the number of energy quanta per unit area per unit time. The greater the number of energy quanta available, the greater is the number of electrons absorbing the energy ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 8 / 24 quanta and therefore, the number of electrons coming out of the metal (for ν > ν 0 ) is more and so is photoelectric current. 15. Three circuits, each consisting of a switch 'S' and two capacitors, are initially charged, as shown in the figure. After the switch has been closed, in which circuit will the charge on the left-hand capacitor (i) increase, (ii) decrease and (iii) remains same ? Give reasons. Solution: When charged capacitors are connected to each other then the charge will flow from the capacitor with higher potential towards the capacitor with lower potential untill a common potential is reached. (a) In fig. (a) the potential of both the capacitor is same so the charge on left hand capacitor remains the same (b) In fig. (b) the potential of left hand capacitor is high so charge from 6Q to 3Q. Therefore charge on left hand capacitor will decrease. (c) In fig. (c) the potential of left hand capacitor is low so charge will flow from 3Q to 6Q. Therefore charge on left hand capacitor will increase. 16. The outputs of two NOT gates are fed to a NOR gate. Draw the logic circuit of the combination of gates. Write its truth table.

With the help of a circuit diagram, explain the working of a junction diode as a full wave rectifier. Draw its input and output waveforms. Which characteristic property makes the junction diode suitable for rectification? Solution: (a) A Full-wave rectifier circuit; (b) Input wave forms given to the diode D1 at A and to the diode D2 at B; (c) Output waveform across the load RL connected in the full-wave rectifier circuit. The circuit using two diodes, shown in Fig.(a), gives output rectified voltage corresponding to both the positive as well as negative half of the ac cycle. Hence, it is known as full-wave rectifier. Here the p-side of the two diodes are connected to the ends of the secondary of the transformer. The n-side of the diodes are connected together, and the output is taken between this common point of diodes and the midpoint of the secondary of the transformer. So for a full-wave rectifier the secondary of the transformer is provided with a centre tapping and so it is called centre-tap transformer. As can be seen from Fig.(c) the voltage rectified by each diode is only half the total secondary voltage. Each diode rectifies only for half the cycle, but the two do so for alternate cycles. Thus, the output between their common terminals and the centretap of the transformer becomes a full-wave rectifier output. Suppose the ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 11 / 24 input voltage to A with respect to the centre tap at any instant is positive. It is clear that, at that instant, voltage at B being out of phase will be negative as shown in Fig.(b). So, diode D1 gets forward biased and conducts (while D2 being reverse biased is not conducting). Hence, during this positive half cycle we get an output current (and a output voltage across the load resistor RL) as shown in Fig.(c). In the course of the ac cycle when the voltage at A becomes negative with respect to centre tap, the voltage at B would be positive. In this part of the cycle diode D 1 would not conduct but diode D 2 would, giving an output current and output voltage (across R L ) during the negative half cycle of the input ac. Thus, we get output voltage during both the positive as well as the negative half of the cycle. The diode under forward biased offers negligible resistance so it will conduct while under reverse biased it offers very high resistance so it will not conduct. Therefore it is a unidirectional device which conducts only in one direction. This characteristic property makes the junction diode suitable for rectification 18. A potential difference V is applied across a conductor of length L and diameter D. How is the drift velocity, v d , of charge carriers in the conductor affected when (i) V is halved, (ii) L is doubled and (iii) D is halved ? justify your answer in each case.

Deduce the expression for the torque  acting on a planar loop of area A and carrying current I placed in a uniform magnetic field B . If the loop is free to rotate, what would be its orientation in stable equilibrium ? Solution: ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 12 / 24 (a) The area vector of the loop ABCD makes an arbitrary angle  with the magnetic field. (b) Top view of the loop. The forces F 1 and F 2 acting on the arms AB and CD are indicated. We consider the case when the plane of the loop, is not along the magnetic field, but makes an angle  with it. Fig.(a) illustrates this general case. The forces on the arms BC and DA are equal, opposite, and act along the axis of the coil, which connects the centres of mass of BC and DA. Being collinear along the axis they cancel each other, resulting in no net force or torque. The forces on arms AB and CD are F 1 and F 2 . They too are equal and opposite, with magnitude, F 1 = F 2 = I b B But they are not collinear! This results in a couple Fig.(b) is a view of the arrangement from the AD end and it illustrates these two forces constituting a couple. The magnitude of the torque on the loop is, 1 2 sin sin 2 2 a a F F      sin I ab B   = I A B sin θ ... (i) As 0,   the perpendicular distance between the forces of the couple also approaches zero. This makes the forces collinear and the net force and torque zero. The torques in above equation can be expressed as vector product of the magnetic moment of the coil and the magnetic field. We define the magnetic moment of the current loop as, m = I A where the direction of the area vector A is given by the right-hand thumb rule and is directed into the plane of the paper in Fig.(a). Then as the angle between m and B is θ , equation (i) can be expressed by one expression m B    we see that the torque  vanishes when m is either parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field B This indicates a state of equilibrium as there is no torque on the coil (this also applies to any object with a magnetic moment m ). When m and B re parallel the equilibrium is a stable one. 21. How are electromagnetic waves produced ? What is the source of the energy carried by a propagating electromagnetic wave ? Identify the electromagnetic radiations used (i) In remote switches of household electronic device; and (ii) as diagnostic tool in medicine ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 13 / 24 Solution: According to Maxwell’s theory accelerated charges radiate electromagnetic waves. Consider a charge oscillating with some frequency. (An oscillating charge is an example of accelerating charge.) This produces an oscillating electric field in space, which produces an oscillating magnetic field, which in turn, is a source of oscillating electric field, and so on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields thus regenerate each other, so to speak, as the wave propagates through the space. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave naturally equals the frequency of oscillation of the charge. The energy associated with the propagating wave comes at the expense of the energy of the source – the accelerated charge. The electromagnetic radiation used are : (1) Infrared rays (2) X-rays 22. (a) A ray of light is incident normally on the face AB of a right angled glass prism of refractive index 1.5. a g   The prism is partly immersed in a liquid of unknown refractive index. Find the value of refractive index of the liquid so that the ray grazes along the face BC after refraction through the prism. (b) Trace the path of the rays if it were incident normally on the face AC. Solution: Given the refractive index of prism μg = 1.5 the ray will grazes along the face BC when the angle of incidence i is equal to the critical angle for the glass and liquid interface here i = 60° (from the fig.) and sin i g    sin g u i   1.5 sin 60   1.3   So the refractive index of the liquid is 1.3 ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 14 / 24 The angle of incidence for ray 1 and ray 2 on face BC is equal to 30° For ray 1 The critical angle for glass-air interface is 1 sin .66 1.5 a c g i      41 c i  Now since the angle of incidence is smaller than the critical angle refraction will take place as shown in figure For ray 2 the critical angle for glass-liquid interface is 1.3 sin 0.866 1.5 c g i      60 c i  Now since the angle of incidence is smaller than the critical angle refraction will take place as shown in figure Section D 23. Sunita and her friends visited an exhibition . The policeman asked them to pass through a metal detector. Sunita's friends were initially scared of it. Sunita, however, explained to them the purpose and working of the metal detector. Answer the following questions : (a) On what principle does a metal detector work ? (b) Why does the detector emit sound when a person carrying any metallic object walks through it ? (c) State any two qualities which Sunita displayed while explaining the purpose of walking through the detector. Solution: (a) The metal detector works on the principle of resonance in ac circuit. (b) When Sunita's friend is passed through a metal detector, her friend in fact, passing through a coil of many turns. The coil is connected to a capacitor tuned so that the circuit is in resonance. When she walk through the metal in her pocket, the impedance of the circuit changes-resulting in significant change in current in the circuit. The change in current is detected and the electric circuitry causes a sound to be emitted as an alarm. (c) Curiosity, power of observation. Section E 24. (a) State Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction . (b) Explain, with the help of a suitable example, how we can show that Lenz's law is a consequence of the principle of conservation of energy. ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 15 / 24 (c) Use the expression for Lorentz force acting on the charge carriers of a conductor to obtain the expression for the induced emf across the conductor of length l moving with velocity v through a magnetic field B acting perpendicular to its length. OR (a) Using phasor diagram, derive the expression for the current flowing in an ideal inductor connected to an a.c. source of voltage, v=v 0 sin . t  Hence plot graphs showing variation of (i) applied voltage and (ii)the current as a function of . t  (b) Derive an expression for the average power dissipated in a series LCR circuit. Solution (a) Faraday gave laws for relating induced emf to the flux. These are given as under : (i) Whenever there is a change of magnetic flux through a circuit, there will be an induced emf and this will last as long as the change persists. (ii) The magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equal to the time rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit. Mathematically, the induced emf is given by B d dt    (b) Lenz's law states that the polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it. The negative sign shown in equation B d dt    represents this effect. Conservation of energy : Suppose that the induced current was in the direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig.(a). In that case, the South-pole due to the induced current will face the approaching North-pole of the magnet. The bar magnet will then be attracted towards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration. A gentle push on the magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energy will continuously increase without expending any energy. If this can happen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by a suitable arrangement. This violates the law of conservation of energy and hence can not happen. Now consider the correct case shown in Fig.(a). In this situation, the bar magnet experiences a repulsive force due to the induced current. Therefore, a person has to do work in moving the magnet. Where does the energy spent by the person go? This energy is dissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current. (c) ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 16 / 24 The arm PQ is moved to the left side, thus decreasing the area of the rectangular loop. This movement induces a current I as shown. Let us consider a straight conductor moving in a uniform and time independent magnetic field. Figure shows a rectangular conductor PQRS in which the conducto r PQ is free to move. The rod PQ is moved towards the left with a constant velocity v as shown in the figure. Assume that there is no loss of energy due to friction. PQRS forms a closed circuit enclosing an area that changes as PQ moves. It is placed in a uniform magnetic field B which is perpendicular to the plane of this system. If the length RQ=x and RS  the magnetic flux B  enclosed by the loop PQRS will be Bx   Since x is changing with time, the rate of change of flux φ B will induce an emf given by:   B dBx d dt dt     dx B Bv dt   where we have used dx/dt = – v which is the speed of the conductor PQ. The induced emf Bv is called motional emf. Thus, we are able to produce induced emf by moving a conductor instead of varying the magnetic field, that is, by changing the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit. It is also possible to explain the motional emf expression by invoking the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of conductor PQ. Consider any arbitrary charge q in the conductor PQ. When the rod moves with speed v, the charge will also be moving with speed v in the magnetic field B. The Lorentz force on this charge is qvB in magnitude, and its direction is towards Q. All charges experience the same force, in magnitude and direction, irrespective of their position in the rod PQ. The work done in moving the charge from P to Q is, W qvB  Since emf is the work done per unit charge, W q   Bv  This equation gives emf induced across the rod PQ The total force on the charge at P is given by   F qE v B    OR (a) ","CBSE-XII-2015 EXAMINATION 17 / 24 Figure (a)shows an ac source connected to an inductor. Usually, inductors have appreciable resistance in their windings, but we shall assume that this inductor has negligible resistance. Thus, the circuit is a purely inductive ac circuit. Let the voltage across the source be sin . m V V t   Using the Kirchhoff’s loop rule,  0, t    and since there is no resistor in the circuit, 0 ...( ) di v L i dt   where the second term is the self-induced Faraday emf in the inductor; and L is the self-inductance of the inductor. The negative sign follows from Lenz’s law. From equation (i) we have sin ...( ) m di v v t ii dt L L    Equation (ii) implies that the equation for i(t), the current as a function of time, must be such that its slope di dt is a sinusoidally varying quantity, with the same phase as the source voltage and an amplitude given by . vm L To obtain the current, we integrate di/dt with respect to time: sin( ) m di v dt t dt dt L     and get   cos tan m v i t cons t L     The integration constant has the dimension of current and is time independent. Since the source has an emf which oscillates symmetrically about zero, the current it sustains also oscillates symmetrically about zero, so that no constant or time-independent component of the current exists. Therefore, the integration constant is zero. Using   cos sin , 2 t t             we have sin 2 m i i t           Where m m v i L   is the amplitude of the current.

The inductive reactance limits the current in a purely inductive circuit in the same way as the resistance limits the current in a purely resistive circuit. The inductive reactance is directly proportional to the inductance and to the frequency of the current. (b) We have seen that a voltage sin m v v t   applied to a series RLC circuit drives a current in the circuit given by   sin m i i t     where 1 tan m C L m v X X i and z R            Therefore, the instantaneous power p supplied by the source is     sin sin m m p vi v t i t              cos cos 2 2 mm vi t           The average power over a cycle is given by the average of the two terms in R.H.S. of above equation. It is only the second term which is time-dependent. Its average is zero (the positive half of the cosine cancels the negative half). Therefore, cos cos 2 2 2 mm m m vi v i P     cos VI   This can also be written as 2 cos P IZ   So, the average power dissipated depends not only on the voltage and current but also on the cosine of the phase angle  between them.

The first inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal plane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for final image formation at infinity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly, the final image is inverted with respect to the original object. We now obtain the magnification due to a compound microscope.

The distance L, i.e., the distance between the second focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece (focal length f e ) is called the tube length of the compound microscope.

Draw V – I characteristics of a p-n junction diode. Answer the following questions, giving reasons : (i) Why is the current under reverse bias almost independent of the applied potential upto a critical voltage ? (ii) Why does the reverse current show a sudden increase at the critical voltage Name any semiconductor device which operates under the reverse bias in the breakdown region. Solution: (i) When p-n junction is reverse baised, the majority carriers in p and n region are repelled away from the junction. There is small current due to the minority carriers. This current attains its maximum or saturation value immediately and is independent of the applied reverse voltage (ii) As the reverse voltage is increased to a certain value, called break down voltage, large amount of covalent bonds in p and n regions are broken. As a result of this, large electron-hole pairs are produced which diffuse through the junction and hence there is a sudden rise in the reverse current. Once break down voltage is reached, the high reverse current may damage the ordinary junction diode. Device is zener diode. 20. Define the current sensitivity of a galvanometer. Write its S.I. unit.
